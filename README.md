# CliNotes - AI-Powered Journaling App
## About

CliNotes is an intelligent command-line interface (CLI) tool that transforms your development journaling experience with AI-powered insights. Whether you're logging development progress, reflecting on learning experiences, or storing code snippets, CliNotes provides smart analysis to help you understand your thoughts and feelings over time.

## Vision

### There are three main features for this application
- **AI Journal** ðŸ¤–
  - An intelligent journaling system with automatic sentiment analysis and tag generation
  - `cliNotes journal add "Today I started a Rust project and I'm excited about learning systems programming!"`
  - AI automatically analyzes sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and generates relevant tags
  - Smart summarization: `cliNotes journal summarize --period week`
  - Intelligent insights: `cliNotes journal insights "How have I felt about my coding projects this month?"`
  - Perfect for developers who want to track their emotional journey and learning progress
  - Export capabilities to integrate with other journaling apps
- Learning Notes
  - Learning Notes aims to be a vimWiki type place but this is a long term vision for it
  - For now I am only aiming for it to be a collection of md files stored with this app being the only common connection between them
  - So basically you can have MD files scattered throughout your PC and through this app you can "collect" it together
- Code Snippets
  - Throughout the day we visit Stack Overflow or ChatGPT many times
  - We use the code there once and then either commit to git or just use the command once and then forget all about it 
  - Until we have to use Google again and research the same query
  - Sometimes the results are not the same and so such a useful snippet gets lost
  - Remember that email regex you saw on SO ? yeah, where is it now? I bet its no where
  - With cliNotes you can simply do this
